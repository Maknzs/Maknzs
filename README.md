## 🔹 What I Do

I work at the intersection of finance, mathematics, and code — building quantitative models and risk analytics tools that translate financial theory into practical, data-driven systems.

**Focus Areas:**
- Market Risk & Portfolio Risk Analytics  
- Quantitative Finance & Financial Engineering  
- Statistical Modeling & Time-Series Analysis  
- Financial Data Engineering (Python, pandas, NumPy, SQL)  
- Software Development & Tooling

## 🔹 Featured Project

### 📊 Market Risk VaR Engine

A multi-asset portfolio risk monitoring toolkit replicating a simplified bank market risk workflow.

**Implements:**
- Historical VaR (95%, 99%)
- Parametric Normal VaR (rolling volatility)
- EWMA (RiskMetrics-style) VaR
- Rolling covariance-matrix VaR
- Historical Expected Shortfall (ES / CVaR)
- VaR backtesting & Kupiec coverage test
- Exception reporting (CSV export)
- Stress testing & scenario analysis
- Component (marginal) VaR decomposition
- Pre-trade risk impact simulation

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
- Portfolio risk aggregation  
- Correlation-driven risk dynamics  
- Tail risk measurement  
- Statistical model validation  
- Risk contribution analysis
